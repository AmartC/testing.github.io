From: Eliminating Fraud and Abuse: 
  Fraud and abuse added as much as $98 billion to Medicare and Medicaid spending in 2011  

From Improving Care: 
  EHR design and configuration must: (1) facilitate clinical staff to perform work as necessary and to the extent their licensure and privileges permit and (2) allow physicians to dynamically allocate and delegate work to appropriate members of the care team as permitted by institutional policies"

From https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16903660
  There is a tremendous potential to reduce healthcare fraud and achieve substantial financial benefits using a nationwide health information network with interoperable electronic health records. To achieve these benefits, there must be interoperability among providers and between providers and payers.

title: "Mapping (coming soon)"
definition: "Each data element in the SHR can be mapped to other standards to facilitate interoperability and transitions to the SHR. For example, a mapping of the SHR to HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) profiles is defined using mappings. Each value and field of each data element can be mapped to corresponding representations in the target standard."

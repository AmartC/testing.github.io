title: "Data Element"
definition: "Data elements are built from simpler data elements or primitive types which are the same as in FHIR. Data Elements are atomic or molecular. Atomic data elements are composed of just one value. Molecular data elements are composed of at most 1 value and zero to many fields. A data element value is what the element IS. A data element field is what the element HAS (or QUALIFY the value)."

title: "Is the SHR technical approach different than what has been done previously for Health Data Interoperability in the US?"
paragraphs: 
    - 
      p: "Yes. To explain why the SHR approach is different requires some background."
    - 
      p: "Twenty years ago, the healthcare industry turned towards interoperability standards to improve healthcare information exchange. However, the very lack of <em>data</em> consistency was not acknowledged and has led to exchange standards that are purposefully left extremely flexible, allowing enough freedom to model the information in virtually any EHR system. Even new standards like HL7’s FAST Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) have made a deliberate decision to remain flexible and ambiguous on data specificity for this same reason. While FHIR provides a stronger foundation then previous healthcare exchange standards, problems of inconsistent implementation and semantic interoperability remain."
    - 
      p: "Today there are over 1,500 different EMR/EHR health IT system products certified as part of <a href='https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/meaningful-use-regulations'>HHS Meaningful Use</a>. Most of those health IT products are themselves highly configurable, to facilitate flexibility in divergent clinical settings. This explains why, even after the nearly universal adoption of health IT technology has occurred, the primary mechanism of communication between clinicians remains the fax machine, which is reliant on manual human interpretation of text on paper."
    - 
      p: "In our view, the real problem lies much deeper than the flexibility of information exchange standards. In addition to capturing too much information as free text, the fundamental problem is that today’s health IT systems contain semantically incompatible information. Because of the great variety of the data models of EMR/EHR systems, transferring information from one health IT system to another frequently results in the distortion or loss of information, blocking of critical details, or introduction of erroneous data. This is unacceptable in healthcare."
    - 
      p: "The approach of the Standard Health Record (SHR) is to standardize the health record and health data itself, rather than focusing on exchange standards. When the health record and data is standardized, exchange and aggregation of patient information will become trivial (as in every other industry that has gone digital)."

title: "Will SHR address only &ldquo;traditional electronic health records&rdquo; or will SHR be much broader in scope and include non-hospital health data?"
paragraphs: 
    - 
      p: "The plan is to initially focus on electronic health record data for patient identification, emergency care, and primary care. After those initial domains have been developed, the Standard Health Record will be expanded to cover other domains such as precision care, outpatient care, genomics, social determinants of health, and patient generated data. Early SHR work will establish a repeatable process to &ldquo;standardize health data&rdquo; that will be extended to new use cases as an evolutionary strategy to standardize the majority of modern health data."

      p: "The SHR community will look to the national healthcare community at large to help identify the key health data domains to add next. However, we want to begin with a manageable yet impactful set of initial domains to prove the SHR concept and define the technical representation. We will continue to work through the consensus process, better understand and develop solutions to policy, privacy, patient consent, and security issues around the SHR."

paragraphs: 
    - 
      p: "The SHR Collaborative is an open-source, health data interoperability effort based at The MITRE Corporation in Bedford, MA. The Collaborative's central focus is to establish standards for the structure and content of health record information."
    - 
      p: "The SHRC is prototyping the Standard Health Record (SHR) by leveraging existing medical record models, distilling from them a central, necessary set of structures and content. Initial SHR implementations will prioritize patient identification, primary care and emergency care providers. The SHR is patient and provider-centric, and addresses the dynamic data needs of providers, patients, and caregivers by including data specifications for many areas related to social determinants of health."

      p: "The SHRC focuses on the needs of the patient, including the need to manage their own data. The SHR Collaborative holds that patients must have access to their data in an understandable, portable, and transparent manner. By using an open source model, the SHR actively promotes industry innovation by leveraging big-data at the patient and population level to increase patient engagement, support public health and research needs, and ensure providers consistently have the right information, at the right time, for the right person."

title: "What do we think will make SHR successful when past efforts have failed?"
paragraphs: 
    - 
      p: "MITRE and the SHR open source community recognize that achieving consistency in healthcare data is a difficult problem to solve. There will be resistance to change and building consensus will be a challenge. MITRE and the SHR open source community’s influence on health policy and health standards will be as important as the SHR technical innovation. This is why the SHR effort invests heavily in engagement with healthcare thought leaders and healthcare alliances. The SHR community is connecting with medical associations, standards organizations, and vendor consortia such as Commonwell Health Alliance, the Argonauts, the National Association for Trusted Exchange (NATE), the Carequality Collaborative, The Sequoia Project, and the Healthcare Services Platform Consortium."

      p: "The SHR Collaborative will also build on existing standards and borrow from similar initiatives outside of the US. For example, the ONC Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS), which mandates several types of information be exchanged during transitions of care, is a natural building block for the SHR. England has published standards for the clinical structure and content of patient records. Both England and US standards fall short of defining the structured data necessary for a computable SHR, so we are addressing that today. Other existing data models, such as the Federal Health Information Model (FHIM), the OMOP Common Data Model, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) “Common Data Model”, and FHIR resources provide important and valuable inputs. But none of these models, nor any similar healthcare model that we are aware of, fully defines the content of a useful, complete standard health record."

      p: "With FHIR establishing a solid foundation for basic exchange, the time is right to try and solve this critical problem. MITRE and the SHR open source community can provide a target and start working towards nationwide adoption of the SHR."

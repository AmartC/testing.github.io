title: "Is anyone else standardizing health data or is the SHR project alone?"
paragraphs: 
    - 
      p: "This is not the first effort to standardize health data. Internationally, many of the top healthcare systems in the world have defined or are in the process of developing a standard health record. For example, a standard health record (the Summary Care Record) has been successfully adopted in England, and it has provided very positive results. Many developed countries have some form of a standard health record. The US is behind in this respect."

      p: "While international efforts will help to inform the Standard Health Record, there are many areas where the SHR project can leapfrog those older developments. For instance, many of the internationally defined standard health records focus on standardizing narrative data sections alone and do not address fine-grained structured data. We will use FHIR to access and exchange the contents of the SHR down to individual data elements (e.g. current patient core temperature in degrees F). There are other groups whose work can be leveraged to accelerate the SHR, including the Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI). The CIMI project is developing a detailed specification for exchanging laboratory health information that may also leverage the SHR."
